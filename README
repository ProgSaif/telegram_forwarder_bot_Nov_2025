Overview
This is a Python-based Telegram bot that automatically copies messages from multiple source channels to multiple target channels. The bot preserves message formatting, media, and buttons when forwarding. It was imported from GitHub and configured to run in the Replit environment on November 21, 2025.

How It Works
The bot connects to Telegram using the Telethon library
Listens for new messages in configured source channels
Copies each message (with formatting, media, and buttons) to all target channels
Includes flood wait error handling and retry logic
Prevents message loops by ignoring messages sent by the bot itself
Configuration
Required Environment Variables
The bot requires the following environment variables to be set in Replit Secrets:

API_ID: Your Telegram API ID (get from https://my.telegram.org)
API_HASH: Your Telegram API hash (get from https://my.telegram.org)
SOURCES: Comma-separated list of source channel identifiers (e.g., @channel1,@channel2,-1001234567890)
TARGETS: Comma-separated list of target channel identifiers (e.g., @target1,@target2,-1009876543210)
Optional Environment Variables
SESSION_NAME: Name for the Telegram session file (default: multi-fwd-session)
DELAY: Delay in seconds between forwarding to different targets (default: 0.5)
Channel Identifiers
Channels can be specified using:

Username format: @channelname
ID format: -1001234567890 (for private channels)
Setup Instructions
First-Time Setup
Get Telegram API Credentials:

Visit https://my.telegram.org
Log in with your phone number
Go to "API development tools"
Create an application to get your API_ID and API_HASH
Add Secrets in Replit:

Click on "Secrets" (lock icon) in the left sidebar
Add the required environment variables:
API_ID: Your Telegram API ID
API_HASH: Your Telegram API hash
SOURCES: Your source channels (comma-separated)
TARGETS: Your target channels (comma-separated)
Start the Bot:

The bot will start automatically via the workflow
On first run, you'll need to authenticate:
Enter your phone number when prompted
Enter the code sent to your Telegram app
If you have 2FA enabled, enter your password
Verify Operation:

Check the console logs to ensure the bot logged in successfully
Test by sending a message to one of your source channels
Verify it appears in all target channels
Workflow Configuration
The project uses a single workflow:

Name: Telegram Bot
Command: python main.py
Type: Console (long-running background process)
Session Management
The bot creates a session file (e.g., multi-fwd-session.session) after the first authentication. This file is:

Stored locally in the Replit workspace
Included in .gitignore to prevent accidental commits
Allows the bot to reconnect without re-authentication
Error Handling
The bot includes built-in error handling for:

FloodWaitError: Automatically waits the required time before retrying
Missing credentials: Exits with clear error message if API_ID or API_HASH is missing
Message copy failures: Logs errors but continues processing other messages

Notes
This is a bot application (no frontend/backend web components)
Requires active Telegram API credentials to function
The bot must be added as an admin to source and target channels if they are private
Message delay prevents Telegram rate limiting
